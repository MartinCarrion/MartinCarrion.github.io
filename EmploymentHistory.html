                        as an Inventory Specilist, my responsibility consisted of Counting and Tracking
                        Inventory, organizing and handling customer orders, and using the inventory system
                        called Retek Support System. Aside from these responsibilities, I have gained experience
                        in customer relations, product analysis, and time management.
